        <ul><strong>Instruction:</strong><br>
          <li>Hover on each cloud to pause its movement (or test if you could keep up with them!).</li>
          <li>Hover on the suns if you are not afraid of the burning heat.</li>

          <p><strong>Concept:</strong><br>
          <cite>A Summer Gasp</cite> is a melancholic contemplation of a boy's anthropomorphic sadness about 
          the meaning of its existence.
          The website is based on the illusion that the sadness creature sees due to 
          the scorching heat of summer, while hanged upside down.<br>

<!-- Reflection -->
<!-- 
  UPDATES: 
  Some adjustments have been done compared to my original proposal.
  - For example, I did not create the solid clouds to hide the the text clouds but instead going straight to revealing them,
  and the hover interaction is used to pause the clouds to let the user read the content.
  //
  - I also remove the wiping blur mask to reveal the scene effect, since it is a nice feature to have, but not the most necessary one.
  The biggest reason is that my skill is still limited, and considering the project's time scope, focusing on creating the paint brush effect
  alone will take a lot of time, so I decide to leave it as an exercise outside of this course and concentrate on other must-have elements.
  //
  - From in-class feedback, I added the scale and rotation transform to the suns triggered by hover interaction instead of being static.

  CHALLENGES:
  - I wanted to animate the ocean waves to move on the x-axis from one side to the other side and loop.
  However, when I replace the svg of the original code with my wave-2.png, the repeat-x of could not create a seamless edge among the waves.
  - Eventually, I just move the waves on the y-axis and it turned out less disruptive to the user's interaction with the poem as I want the movement
  to be very subtle, but I still wonder how the issue above could be solved.
  //
  - Sometimes when the mouse cursor hovers on the sun or blank areas, though the cloud does not move in where the cursor is yet,
  the cursor selects the cloud layer because of the width of cloud's box (transparent). 
  - I tried to fix this by giving the two elements two different cursors to give the user feedback of what their cursor actually hovers on.
  However, it will need a more efficient solution if it is developed into a wider project to avoid causing confusion.
  //
  - About the audio, because the file size was too big, I could not upload the project folder on github.
  - I found the "Adding a file to a repository using the command line" but it sounds so complicated so I edited the source to only 18s and converted to a .mp3 file.
  The background sound just loops anyway so I think that is ok for now.
  - However it may be difficult for projects in which I need to keep the original big file sizes, so I may need to clone my repository on local computer
  or using the Git Large File Size Storage.
