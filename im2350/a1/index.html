    <h2>Interactive Experience Research Project</h2>

    <h3>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>

    <p>When I first interacting with the website, the page's title 
      
      <a href="https://goodbye.monster/" target="_blank"><cite>Goodbye.monster</cite></a> 
      
      stood out from the rest because it has the largest size, written in bold text, and placed in the middle.

    <h3>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>I clicked on the <i>Just visiting</i> box to start the exploring.</li>
      <li>I waited the game to start loading.</li>
      <li>I clicked on the link <u>Someone</u>, which takes me to a homepage, but does not give me any option to change name.</li>
      <li>I read the pop-up narratives as they are appearing.</li>
      <li>I listened to the background music.</li>
      <li>I clicked on the <i>Lie here</i> box.</li>
      <li>I clicked on the floating shape consisting of three squares that represents the creature.</li>
      <li>I clicked on the box <i>Offer</i> but nothing is in there.</li>
      <li>I clicked the <i>Back</i> box.</li>
      <li>I read the narrative.</li>
      <li>I clicked on the <i>Stand</i> box.</li>
      <li>I clicked on the <u>scan your surrounding</u> link.</li>
      <li>I clicked on the <i>Stagnant Puddle</i> box, which shows two options <i>dead larvae</i> or <i>molding leaves</i>.</li>
      <li>I clicked on the <i>dead larvae</i>.</li>
      <li>I read the narrative.</li>
      <li>I clicked on <i>Take</i>.</li>
      <li>I click on the floating icon of the monster.</li>
      <li>I clicked on <i>Offer</i> which showed <i>dead larvae (1)</i>.</li>
      <li>I clicked on <i>dead larvae</i>.</li>
      <li>I read the narrative.</li>
      <li>I clicked on <i>Rest</i>.</li>
      <li>I clicked on <i>Back</i>.</li>
      <li>I clicked on <i>Think</i>.</li>
      <li>I read the narrative, which suggested a new name.</li>
      <li>I clicked on <i>Think</i> because the name was still not satisfying.</li>
      <li>I read the narrative.</li>
      <li>I clicked on <i>Nod</i> to decide the final name for my monster.</li>
      <li>I read the narrative.</li>
      <li>I clicked on <i>Remember</i>.</li>
      <li>I read the narrative.</li>

    </ul>

   <h3>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>

   <p>I spent most of my time on reading the narratives to select the options that the game offered.</p>

   <h3>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
   
   <p>My most common action was clicking, such as 
    clicking on links for new narratives to unfold, clicking on buttons for navigation between pages, 
    and clicking on the options which the game offered.</p>

   <h3>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
  
   <p>My first impression was that the game encouraged the player to adopt a virtual creature in a post-apocalyptic setting, 
    where they are a loner and need to find objects to feed it and keep it alive.</p>

   <h3>6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>

   <p>The game shows me objects that I can decide to <em>Take</em> or <em>Leave</em>. If I choose <i>Take</i>, 
    the object will be collected and displayed in the <i>Offer</i> box inside my virtual monster, which then I can to select to feed it.
    By describing the creature's behaviour similar to that of a pet, such as it resting on the player, and asking the player to choose 
    between <em>Think</em> or <em>Nod</em> to the suggestion(s) of the creature's name, the interactive experience evokes a sense of 
    bonding between me and the virtual pet. Therefore, I feel a responsibility to take care of my company.
     </p>

   <h3>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>

   <p>
    The two-minute experience does not do the game justice, because it was just enough for an introduction.
    As I explore over time, I realize that there is a philosophical aspect about the narrative and the interconnected 
    structure of the webpages was more sophisticated than I though. The inevitable temporary existence of the virtual creature and certain objects
    unabled to collect indicate that the player needs to accept goodbye as it is and keep going on the journey to unlock new places.
   </p> 
    
   <p>
    I suggest playing it for ten to fifteen minutes to enjoy the game's slow-paced storytelling and 
    to explore the linked paths of the web. Also, it should be interacted with at least 2 times. 
    First time is to engage with the poetic and nostalgic script, interact with the vulnerable monster and get an overall sense of navigation. 
    Second time is to explore the diversity of destinations through different links within the webpages, have fun with the provided options, 
    and to appreciate the visual elements, such as the graphics and animation of each place and the layout structure.
  </p>

   <h3>8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time? </h3>

   <p>
    The interactive experience does not signal the journey has ended or not, but rather, the player can stay in the game for as long as they like.
    The adventure only ends if the player logs off or closes the browser. Once the monster is dead, the player can still continue the adventure 
    and explore links to go to new destinations. However, when all the scripts have been generated, they could be repetitive 
    and the collected items are no longer available to select, nor new items show up. 
    For example, I was wandering from one page to another until I had read all the scenarios and left with a collection of items
    without knowing what they will be used for, which tells me that the game is only over when I become bored of it and log off. 
    After that, the new game restarts.
