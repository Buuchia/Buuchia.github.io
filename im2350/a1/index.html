   <h3 class="speech left">3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>

   <p class="speech right">I spent most of my time on reading the narratives to select the options that the game offered.</p>

   <h3 class="speech left">4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
   
   <p class="speech right">My most common action was clicking, such as 
    clicking on links for new narratives to unfold, clicking on buttons for navigation between pages, 
    and clicking on the options which the game offered.</p>

   <h3 class="speech left">5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
   <!--why does someone want to play this game? The answer needs to be broader-->
  
   <p class="speech right">My impression is that the game aims to encourage the player to go on an adventure, exploring the environments in the game
    and interacting with hidden items to keep the journey going, during which they can adopt and form a companionship with a virtual creature.
    
  </p>

   <h3 class="speech left">6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>

   <p class="speech right">The game shows me objects that I can decide to <em>Take</em> or <em>Leave</em>. If I choose <i>Take</i>, 
    the object will be collected and displayed in the <i>Offer</i> box inside my virtual monster, which then I can to select to feed it.
    By describing the creature's behaviour similar to that of a pet, such as it resting on the player, and asking the player to choose 
    between <em>Think</em> or <em>Nod</em> to the suggestion(s) of the creature's name, the interactive experience evokes a sense of 
    bonding between me and the virtual pet. Therefore, I feel a responsibility to take care of my company.
     </p>

   <h3 class="speech left">7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>

   <p class="speech right">
    The two-minute experience does not do the game justice, because it was just enough for an introduction.
    As I explore over time, I realize that there is a philosophical aspect about the narrative and the interconnected 
    structure of the webpages was more sophisticated than I though. The inevitable temporary existence of the virtual creature and certain objects
    unabled to collect indicate that the player needs to accept goodbye as it is and keep going on the journey to unlock new places.
   <br>
    I suggest playing it for ten minutes to enjoy the game's slow-paced storytelling and 
    to explore the linked paths of the web. Also, it should be interacted with at least 2 times. 
    First time is to engage with the poetic and nostalgic script, interact with the vulnerable monster and get an overall sense of navigation. 
    Second time is to explore the diversity of destinations through different links within the webpages, have fun with the provided options, 
    and to appreciate the visual elements, such as the graphics and animation of each place and the layout structure.
    <br>
  </p>

   <h3 class="speech left">8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time? </h3>

   <p class="speech right">
    The interactive experience does not signal the journey has ended or not, but rather, the player can stay in the game for as long as they like.
    The adventure only ends if the player logs off or closes the browser. Once the monster is dead, the player can still continue the adventure 
    and explore links to go to new destinations. However, when all the scripts have been generated, they could be repetitive 
    and the collected items are no longer available to select. There is no updates of new items or new script, either. 
    For example, I was wandering from one page to another until I had read all the scenarios and left with a collection of items
    without knowing what they will be used for, which tells me that the game is only over when I become bored of it and log off. 
    After that, the new game restarts.
   </p>

   <h3 class="speech left">9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>

   <p class="speech right">The navigation experience references treasure hunt video games, where players find textual and visual clues to solve a problem.</p>

   <h3 class="speech left">10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
   <!-- relates to the treasure hunt i played the past, how do u know to click that button, find the similarities-->
   
   <p class="speech right">
     In a treasure hunt video game, there are usually instructions of how to get to a certain area and items laying at random spots, 
     which can be kept in a collection or come back to later. 
     Similarly, <cite>Goodbye.monster</cite> sometimes presents only one option with no other choice acting as an instruction to keep the gameplay going, 
     then it unlocks more descriptive links directing to other search locations. Moreover, when transporting to a new environment in a treasure hunt, 
     it asks player to scan the surroundings to find valuable objects that will help unlock new items or new narrative, or to solve the puzzle.
    </p>

      <p class="speech right">In <cite>Goodbye.monster</cite>, there are also direct tutorials that explicitly tell me to scan the place and more indirect ones such as by buttons changing color
     when the mouse hovers over it to signify that there are hidden elements to explore. 
      </p>
     
        <p class="speech right">About the collected items, previous experiece with treasure hunts video games
     tells me that they will be used with a purpose. Intuitively, and considering one of the goal of the game, which is to take care of the monster pet, I check 
     the <em>Offer</em> box inside it and expect to see if any can be used as food to feed it.
     In terms of <cite>Goodbye.monster</cite>'s structure, the links are scattered along the page like branches of pathways that are seen in treasure hunt maps, some of which
     even specifies the ordinal directions implying a compass, so it is easy to navigate around the locations.
        </p>
  

   <h3 class="speech left">11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
   
   <p class="speech right">
    Treasure hunt video games tend to require the player to be take part in role playing in imagined settings, where they should be adventurous, curious, 
    and be analytical based on visual and textual clues to unlock additional storylines. Therefore, when I engage with Goodbye.monster, I feel the urge to explore all the 
    given options and their scenarios, scrolling all the way down and clicking on everything to not miss any clues. 
    As the web replicates the intercardial directions of a compass, the navigation feels familiar and reliable, also reinforces a sense of nostalgia.
   </p>

   <h3 class="speech left">12.What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>

   <p class="speech right">
    The most frustrating part of the interaction is that once I have gone through all the scenarios, the game does not have new updates so the content becomes repetitive. 
    No matter how I try to keep the monster alive, it is destined to die, then I just wander and collect a bunch of items without a place or thing to use for. 
    If I log off, all of my collection disappear and I have to start fresh again, which is not necessarily a bad thing because it teaches me to appreciate the temporariness of 
    the experience. However, there is not much incentive to stay so gradually it feels time-consuming. 
   </p>

   <h3 class="speech left">13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>

   <p class="speech right">
    The most satisfying part of the interaction is that some environments have their accompanying animated graphics with pixel texture and visual effects responding to 
    my mouse movement. The visualization of the places expresses aesthetic of the early Internet and the interactivity makes me feel that I take part in bringing some lifeness 
    to the places, resonating the game's philosophical aspect of being existential.
